# Cursor + Convex Hackathon Game

This is a [Convex](https://convex.dev/) project created with [`npm create convex`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-convex).

---

- This is a simple, online snake game.  
- You can move your snake with the **arrow keys** or **WASD**.  
- Your snake will have a **yellow border** around its head.  
- Snakes will grow **1 point** when they eat a fruit.  
- Any snake will be **eliminated** if they hit another snake (including itself).  
- Occasionally, the game will generate a **super-fruit**.  
  - If you collect a super-fruit, you gain the ability to instantly eliminate the **closest snake** on the board by pressing the **Space** key.  
  - When holding a super-fruit, the closest snake will have a **red border** around its head.
